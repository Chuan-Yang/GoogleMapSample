# GoogleMapSample
This is an alternative way to solve the map problem in my CMPUT301 project. <br />
A Google Map Api sample code base on my one-day research. <br />
I have achieved following functions: <br />

Display the map <br />
Move the camera of the map <br />
Display current location <br />
Highlight the route between locationA and locationB <br />
Get the distance information <br />
